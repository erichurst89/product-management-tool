# product-management-tool

INTRODUCTION

This project creates a simple product inventory management tool using ReactJS, Node.JS/Express, and MYSQL for the database.
It allows the user to create a product with the attributes of name, upc, and date that it is available and also allows them
to add certain properties to said product such as brand, color, etc.

CONTENTS

It consists of two pages: a product creation page and a listing page. With the product creation page, the user will be able
to enter in products that are to be stored in their invention. The listing page will allow them to pull up an inventory
list where they can check the products that are in their inventory.
